# Gradle Enterprise Build Validation Scripts for Gradle

The purpose of the build validation scripts is to assist you in validating that your Gradle build is in an optimal state in terms of maximizing work avoidance. The validation scripts do not actually modify your build, but they surface what can be improved in your build to avoid unnecessary work in several scenarios.

Each script represents a so-called _experiment_. Each experiment has a very specific focus of what it validates in your build. The experiments are organized in a logical sequence that should be followed diligently to achieve incremental build improvements in an efficient manner. The experiments can be run on a fully unoptimized build, and they can also be run on a build that had already been optimized in the past in order to surface potential regressions.

There are currently five experiments for Gradle. You could also perform these experiments fully manually, but relying on the automation provided by the validation scripts will be faster, less error-prone, and more reproducible.

## Requirements

You need to have [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) installed in order to run the build validation scripts.

If you plan to use the build validation scripts on Windows, then you will need to [install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). The build validation scripts work well on the WSL default distribution (Ubuntu).

## Compatibility

The build validation scripts are compatible with a large range of Gradle versions, as laid out in the table below. Getting the best user experience when running an experiment and when being presented with the results of an experiment requires access to the Gradle Enterprise server that holds the captured build data. Fetching that build data requires a compatible version of Gradle Enterprise, as laid out in the table below.

| Build Validation Scripts version | Compatible Gradle versions | Compatible Gradle Enterprise versions |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1.0 - 1.0.2                      | 5.0+                       | 2021.2+                               |
| 2.0+                             | 5.0+                       | 2022.1+                               |  

## Installation

Use the following command to download and unpack the build validation scripts for Gradle to the current directory:

```bash
curl -s -L -O https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-validation-scripts/releases/download/v2.0/gradle-enterprise-gradle-build-validation-2.0.zip && unzip -q -o gradle-enterprise-gradle-build-validation-2.0.zip
```

## Structure

In the top-level folder, there are five different scripts that you can execute, each one representing
a specific experiment of the build validation process:

- 01-validate-incremental-building.sh
- 02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh
- 03-validate-local-build-caching-different-locations.sh
- 04-validate-remote-build-caching-ci-ci.sh
- 05-validate-remote-build-caching-ci-local.sh

| Script | Experiment |
| :----- | :------ |
| 01-validate-incremental-building.sh | Validates that a Gradle build is optimized for incremental building, implicitly invoked from the same location. |
| 02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh | Validates that a Gradle build is optimized for local build caching when invoked from the same location. |
| 03-validate-local-build-caching-different-locations.sh | Validates that a Gradle build is optimized for local build caching when invoked from different locations. |
| 04-validate-remote-build-caching-ci-ci.sh | Validates that a Gradle build is optimized for remote build caching when invoked from different CI agents. |
| 05-validate-remote-build-caching-ci-local.sh | Validates that a Gradle build is optimized for remote build caching when invoked on CI agent and local machine. |
</details>

All intermediate and final output produced while running a given script is stored under .data/<script_name>/&lt;timestamp>-<run_id>.

## Invocation

The scripts accept command line arguments of which some are the same for all scripts and some are
specific to a given script. The following arguments are present on all scripts:

- `-h`, `--help`: Shows a help message including all command line arguments supported by the script
- `-v`, `--version`: Shows the version number of the script
- `-i`, `--interactive`: Runs the script in interactive mode, providing extra context and guidance along the way

It is recommended that you run a given script in _interactive_ mode for the first time to make yourself familiar
with the flow of that experiment. In the example below, the script is executed interactively.

```bash
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -i
```

Once you are familiar with a given experiment, you can run the script in _non-interactive_ mode. In the example below,
the script is run autonomously with the provided configuration options.

```bash
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -r https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-scan-quickstart -t build
```

You can also combine the _interactive_ mode with some configuration options already provided at the time the script
is invoked, as shown in the example below.

```bash
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -i -r https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-scan-quickstart
```

## Applying the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin

To get the most out of the experiments and also when building with Gradle Enterprise during daily development, it is highly recommended that you apply the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to your build. This free, open-source plugin enhances build scans with additional tags, links, and custom values that are considered during the experiments.

You can find a complete example of how to apply the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin to your build [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/main/common-gradle-enterprise-gradle-configuration/settings.gradle).

## Authenticating with Gradle Enterprise

Some scripts fetch data from build scans that were published as part of running an experiment. The build scan data is fetched by leveraging the [Gradle Enterprise API](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/api-manual/) and the [Gradle Enterprise Export API](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/export-api/). It is not strictly necessary that you have permission to call these APIs to execute a script successfully, but the summary provided once the script has finished running its experiment will be more comprehensive if the build scan data is accessible.

You can check your granted permissions by navigating in the browser to the 'My Settings' section from the user menu of your Gradle Enterprise UI. You need the 'Access build data via the API' permission. Additionally, the script needs an access key to authenticate with the APIs. See [Authenticating with Gradle Enterprise](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#authenticating_with_gradle_enterprise) for details on how to create an access key and storing it locally.

By default, the scripts fetching build scan data try to find the access key in the `enterprise/keys.properties` file within the Gradle user home directory (`~/.gradle` by default). Alternatively, the access key can be specified via the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable. You can also authenticate with the APIs using username and password instead by setting the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_USERNAME` and `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PASSWORD` environment variables.

## Configuring the network settings to connect to Gradle Enterprise

The scripts that fetch build scan data can be configured to use a HTTP(S) proxy, to use a custom Java trust store, and to disable SSL certificate validation when connecting to Gradle Enterprise. The network settings configuration is automatically picked up by the build validation scripts from a `network.settings` file put in the same location as where the scripts are run. A [configuration file template](components/scripts/network.settings) can be found at the same location as where the scripts are located.

If your Gradle Enteprise can only be reached via a HTTP(S) proxy, edit the `network.settings` file and uncomment and update the lines that start with `http.` and `https.`, using the values required by your HTTP(S) proxy server.

If your Gradle Enterprise server is using a certificate signed by an internal Certificate Authority (CA), edit the `network.settings` file and uncomment and update the lines that start with `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`, specifying where your custom trust store is, what type of trust store it is, and the password required to access the trust store.

In the unlikely and insecure case that your Gradle Enterprise server is using a self-signed certificate, edit the `network.settings` file and uncomment and update the lines that start with ` ssl`.

## Configuring custom value lookup names

The scripts that fetch build scan data expect some of it to be present as custom values (Git repository, branch name, and commit id). By default, the scripts assume that these custom values have been created by the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin). If you are not using that plugin but your build still captures the same data under different custom value names, you can provide a mapping file so that the required data can be extracted from your build scans. An example mapping file named [mapping.example](components/scripts/mapping.example) can be found at the same location as where the scripts are located.

```bash
./04-validate-remote-build-caching-ci-ci.sh -i -m mapping.custom
```

## Redirecting build scan publishing

The scripts that run one or more builds locally can be configured to publish build scans to a different
Gradle Enterprise server than the one that the builds point to by passing the `-s` or `--gradle-enterprise-server`
command line argument. In the example below, the script will configure the local builds to publish their build scans
to ge.example.io regardless of what server is configured in the build.

```bash
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -i -s https://ge.example.io
```

## Instrumenting the build with Gradle Enterprise

The scripts that run one or more builds locally can be configured to connect the builds to a given Gradle Enterprise
instance in case the builds are not already connected to Gradle Enterprise by passing the `-e` or `--enable-gradle-enterprise`
command line argument. In the example below, the script will configure the non-instrumented builds to connect to the
Gradle Enterprise server at ge.example.io.

```bash
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -i -e -s https://ge.example.io
```

## Analyzing the results

Once a script has finished running its experiment, a summary of what was run and what the outcome was is printed on
the console. The outcome is primarily a set of links pointing to build scans that were captured as part of running the
builds of the experiment. Some links also point to build scan comparison. The links have been carefully crafted such that
they bring you right to where it is revealed how well your build avoids unnecessary work.

The summary looks typically like in the screenshot below.

## Investigating file resources on the local file system

For the scripts that run one or more builds locally, the file resources that are used and produced by the builds can be investigated on the local file system. This is helpful when trying to understand cache misses due to changes in file inputs of the executed tasks. All intermediate and final output produced while running a given script is stored under .data/<script_name>/&lt;timestamp>-<run_id>.

Note that even when a script needs to run two builds from the same physical location, the individual builds are always preserved in separate folders, allowing to compare the same files from the two builds with each other.

The folder hierarchy produced by the scripts under the .data folder looks typically like in the screenshot below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/231070/147548879-27a77148-bf24-4f9a-902e-460ce2f0c39d.png)

## Using a local Git repository to accelerate the validation process

For the scripts that run one or more builds locally, the scripts can be pointed at a local checkout of the Git repository that contains the build. Even though the scripts always perform a shallow clone of the investigated Git repository to improve performance and to save disk space, it may still be expensive to repeatedly clone the Git repository over the network while going through cycles of validating and optimizing the build.

In the example below, the Git repository is first checked out to a location on the local disc. The script is then invoked and instructed to clone the local copy instead of the remote repository, avoiding any network overhead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-scan-quickstart $HOME/gradle-build-scan-quickstart
./02-validate-local-build-caching-same-location.sh -i -r file://$HOME/gradle-build-scan-quickstart
```
